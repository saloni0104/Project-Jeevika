# Project Jeevika

Jeevika is a website made to act as a platform of communication between the NGOs and the donors by bridging the gap between the two to make the lives of the underpriviledged better. Jeevika also helps the needy to get updated with the latest help drives around them by SMS. People can register their Phone Numbers with us very easily by just sending an SMS.

## Our Idea

Our aim at Jeevika is to support the prolonged struggle of the needy by providing them the basic necessities which are out of their reach. We collaborate with NGOs and support groups, bridging the gap between those who wish to donate and the NGOs, hence acting as an efficient medium of communication.

## How do we exactly work?

1. Any individual willing to donate items for the poor, can put up a request with certain details. If the donation request gets accepted by a nearby NGO, you shall be updated with a message specifying how to get in touch!
2. NGOs can accept the donation requests if the donors live nearby and may send a message through our platform, thus connect.
3. NGOs can add their specific help programmes which are currently active. Hence users on the platform can see and participate in the same.
4. People in need can register phone numbers by just a call and will always be kept updated about the latest ongoing help programmes through SMS.
